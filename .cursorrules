# Rules for SEO Best Practices in Next.js

- Always use next/image for all images instead of <img>. This enables automatic optimization for performance and SEO.
- Add descriptive alt text to every image: e.g., alt="Detailed description of the image for accessibility and search engines".
- For responsive images, always add sizes prop based on layout: e.g., sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw".
- Use priority={true} for above-the-fold images (e.g., hero banners) to improve LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) for Core Web Vitals.
- Add semantic HTML: Use <header>, <main>, <footer>, <article> where appropriate.
- For pages, add unique <title> and meta description in metadata (use export const metadata in app router).
- Optimize for mobile: Ensure images are responsive and use modern formats (WebP/AVIF via next/image).
- Refactor to reduce code duplication: Extract reusable components like image widgets.
- Clean up: Remove unused styles, use Tailwind or CSS modules for better maintainability.
- When refactoring, plan first: Research codebase, ask questions if unclear, then implement.
